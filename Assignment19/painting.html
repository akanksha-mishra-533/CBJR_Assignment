		Painting is one of those hobbies that gives you an opportunity to relax, enjoy and learn at the same time. We cannot imagine our life without colours and the essence of a painting lies in its colour schema itself.
	</p>

	<p id="p2">
		So let’s take a look at some of the reasons that make painting a great hobby:
	</p>

	<h2>Make anything to the tune of your imagination:</h2>
	
	<p id="p3">
		Painting gives you an opportunity to express your feelings and emotions most profoundly.
	</p>

	<p id="p4">
		It gives you the freedom of expression to out pour on the canvas your thoughts directly as well indirectly. You can paint anything and everything you want to!
	</p>

	<h2>Economical:</h2>

	<p id="p5">
		This is one hobby that can cost you from nothing at all to million of dollars. Not having money to spend on a hobby can never be applied to painting. You just need a pencil, a pen or a colour and you can go on and on.
	</p>

	<h2>Learn patience:</h2>

	<p id="p6">
		One of the best thing that someone can learn from painting is patience. It takes time for a master piece to build or a modus operandi to shape.
	</p>

	<p id="p7">
		At moments it gets very irritating but when you paint with persevere and patience, the end work never disappoints you.
	</p>

	<h2>So many mediums to choose from:</h2>

	<p id="p8">
		Acrylic colours, Oil paints, Poster colours, Glass paints, Pencil colours and the list can go on and on. There is no dearth in the world of colours. It is rich of vibrant and sober mediums at the same time.
	</p>

	<h2>Inspirational:</h2>

	<p id="p9">
		Painting has a rich history and culture with pioneers like Leonardo Da Vinci, Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, etc. revolutionising perspectives towards almost everything. Trust me there is no better feeling than loosing yourself in the world of art only to find yourself!
	</p>

	<p id="p10">
		In comfortable homes offered by CoHo, you can relax and paint anytime you want. You need not go to places to inspire you to paint. CoHo’s interiors are enough you motivate you to paint to the tune of your imagination!
