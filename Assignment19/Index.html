						 There is no better companion than a good book. Reading is important because it is good for your overall well-being. Once you start reading, you experience a whole new world. When you start loving the habit of reading you eventually get addicted to it. Reading develops language skills and vocabulary. Reading books is also a way to relax and reduce stress. It is important to read a good book at least for a few minutes each day to stretch the brain muscles for healthy functioning.

						Singing – we all do it, don’t we? In the shower, the car, when no one is listening, we sing. But take it up a notch and singing can be a fun and rewarding hobby. In essence, singing is using the human voice as a musical instrument, and a very flexible instrument at that. It’s the only form of music where there are words to give specific meaning, augmented by the melodies, tones, and rhythms used by other instruments.
